# OneDimDash
A game played in one dimension and therefore only has one controllable aspect, the speed. Playing the game means avoiding obstacles by matching the speed requirement of the obstacle. The game (I just lost the game) therefore focuses on reaction speed and competing for the highest score.

The game is considered finished, and no more features are planned.

## Feature list:
* Fast-paced gameplay
* 2D graphics (because of course you cannot ACTUALLY play a game in one dimension)
* Keyboard game controls
* Mouse and keyboard controlled shell menus
* Scoring and local high scores
* Music and sound effects

## Progress
- [x] Fast-paced gameplay
- [x] 2D graphics
- [x] Keyboard game controls
- [x] Mouse and keyboard controlled shell menus
- [x] Scoring and local high scores
- [x] Music and sound effects

All planned features have been implemented, and the full version has been released.
